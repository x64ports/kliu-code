 * SimpleList Library

 *
 * This library implements a highly efficient, fast, light-weight, and simple
 * list structure in C, with the goal of replacing the slower, heavier and
 * overly complex STL list.
 *
 * This list is intended as a write-once list; once an item has been added,
 * removing it or altering the data in a way that changes the size of the data
 * is unsupported.

/**
 * SLAddRef: Increments the reference counter; SLCreate(Ex) initializes and
 * addrefs the counter, so there is no need to call SLAddRef after SLCreate(Ex).

 * SLRelease: Decrements the reference counter; this will also destroy the list,
 * free the memory, and invalidate the list handle if no references remain.

 * about the reference count; this will invalidate the list handle.

 * NOTE: Do not free the pointer that was returned.

 * newly-created data block of cbData bytes long is returned if memory
 * allocation was successful (otherwise, NULL is returned).  NULL may be passed
 * in pvData if one wishes to use the returned pointer to copy the data.
 *
 * SLAddString(I): Adds a TCHAR string to the end of the list; a pointer to a
 * newly-created data block of cbData bytes long is returned if memory
 * allocation was successful (otherwise, NULL is returned).

/**
 * SLBuildIndex: Fills an array with the data pointers of every item; the array
 * is provided by the caller and must be at least cItems * sizeof(PVOID) bytes
 * in size.  The caller is thus also responsible for maintaining a count of the
 * number of elements in the list.  The current list position is NOT affected.

/**
 * SLSetContextSize: Sets the amount of data allocated for an arbitrary block
 * of user data associated with the list; if successful, a pointer to the data
 * block is returned, otherwise, NULL is returned.  No memory is allocated for
 * the user data block when the list is first created.
 *
 * SLGetContextData: Returns a pointer to the user data block associated with
 * the list; NULL is returned if the data block had not been allocated.
 *
 * SLSetContextData: Copies data to the user data block associated with the
 * list and then returns a pointer to the data block; NULL is returned if the
 * data block had not been allocated.
 *
 * NOTE: Do not free the pointer that was returned; the pointer may also become
 * invalid after a SLRelease, SLDestroy, or SLSetContextSize call.
